## Introduction

My name is Guillermo Cruz. I'm a full stack developer who likes likes to create solutions to problems even if that means hacking my way in to reach the end goal.

## Personal Information

-    **Age:** 39 years.
-    **Location:** Playa del Carmen, Quintana Roo.
-    **Email:** webjunkie00@gmail.com

## Technical Skills
#### Programming Languages:

-   **Python (10 years)**<br />
I've been developing websites, web apps and REST API's. It has been my go to language for any programming task for the last past 10 years.
-   **Javascript (7+ years)**<br />
I started programming in JS almost at the same time I learned HTML. I've never did a full js app because of the security issues and the bad syntax of the language.

-   **ES5/ES6 (2 years)**<br />
I recently started creating UI interfaces along with ReactJS. Main motive because the syntax is better and functional.

-   **SQL (10 years)**<br />
Designing database schemas, creating stored procedures, full text search and geo data.
-   **CSS3 (7 years)**<br />
Used for styling html components and flexbox for layout presentation.
-   **HTML5 (7 years)**<br />
The good ol' HTML.
-   **Swift (3 years)**<br />
I've develop a few apps for iOS. Did not like Xcode that much.

-   **Frameworks:**

-   **Pyramid (5+ years)**<br />
One of the most flexible frameworks I've known. My swiss army knife.
-   **Flask (6 months)**<br />
Almost like Pyramid is very flexible. Very good for small projects.
-   **ReactJS (2 years)**<br />
I took the plunge a few years back. I'm still concerned about the security issues and dependency hell. Only once I've executed `du -sh` on a reactjs project and don't know if I will do it again.

## Unit Testing:

-   Pytest
-   Enzyme

## Crypto Technologies:

-   Web3 (2 years)
-   Blockchain Protocol (2 years)

## Version Control:

## Database Servers:

-   Postgres (6 years)
-   MongoDB (6 months)
-   Cassandra (1 month)

## Dev Ops: 

#### Operating Systems

-   **Linux (8 years)**<br />
I've been deploying apps for almost 8 years. Compiling packages, upgrading, configuration, cron jobs, etc. I always try to keep it old school and deploy Debian whenever possible.
-   **Mac (5 years)**<br />
I started developing on MacOS only because it was a requirement to do iOS programming. 

## Service Providers

-   **Linode (5 years)**<br />
Manage VPS, configuring Node balancers, DNS zones and stats.
-   **Google Compute Engine (6 months)**<br />
Node management and balancing.
-   **Amazon Web Service (1 year)**<br />
Node deployment, managements and Alexa Skills deployment.

-   **Cloudflare (1 year)**<br />
Domain setup, firewall rules, etc.
